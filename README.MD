# Hi, this is a simple project aimed to show how service and web workers run and work.

## In order to start the program:

1. Make sure you have installed the npm library `serve`.
2. You can easily start the server by navigating into the root folder and running the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```
